Calculate dissimilarity distribution of two sequences
=====================================

## Explanation
- Input: In the folder "./data", and we did some preprocessing towards these data. (Include load the data, and cut the unnecessary string;
- Output: The dissimilarity distribution of the sequence group A.
- explanation of dissimililarity distribution: We used edit distance algorithm, to align all the sequences from sequence group A and sequence group B, and calculate the no alignment bases in the sequences A. Accumulate all the no alignment bases in each position. 

## Usage
- python main.py
